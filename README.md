pages.js
========

Lightweight library to simplify navegation between screens in one-page apps

How to use
==========

First of all, design your one-page app so that every screen is an ```<section>``` element wrapped into one single ```<main>``` element: 
. Don't forget to include the pages.js library at the end of the ```<body>```
```html

<body>
        
        <main>
            
            <section id="page1">

            </section>
            
            <section id="page2">

            </section>
            
            <section id="page3">
 
            </section>
            
        </main>
    
        
    </body>

```
